The ServiceStorage class are used by the IDS and EMS injector to manage storage of files.
ServiceYmdStorage esp. provides storage in a \yyyy\mm\dd directory structure.
It also include handling of known paths i.e. keeping track of existing directories.

Todo:
Most of the code from the IDS and EMS injector dealing with files could be mutualized
in a class extending the functionalities provided by ServiceStorage in InjectorBase
esp. if we need to create new injectors based on the file system.
